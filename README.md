# Decentralized Social Media Platform

This project implements a decentralized social media platform using Clarity smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain. It aims to give users more control over their data and content, potentially reducing issues of censorship and data misuse.

2. `create-post`: Create a new post
3. `like-post`: Like an existing post
4. `follow-user`: Follow another user
5. `get-profile`: Retrieve a user's profile information
6. `get-post`: Retrieve details of a specific post

## Getting Started

1. Install the [Clarinet](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet) development environment for Clarity smart contracts.
